# autonomous-construction-rover

This repository contains the STL files for the 3D printed components of the rover used in my recent autonomous construction research with Nils Napp, Maira Saboia, and Vivek Thangavelu at UB. The following components are included: 
*the components that accomodate DC motors with encoders in the Dagu Wild Thumper Chassis
*a simple, small hinge that allows the microcontroller to be lifted up to facilitate working on the guts of the rover
*mounts that hold the voltage regulators and soft switches
*brackets that allow batteries to be press-fit into the chassis
